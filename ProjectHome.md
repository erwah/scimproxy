# SCIM #
The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is under development under IETF.

Our intention is to release scimproxy as a production quality, plugin based, SCIM Service Provider that can lift user information to the cloud.

Project is developed by Erik Wahlstr√∂m, Samuel Erdtman and Daniel Lindau and the development of scimproxy is sponsored by [Technology Nexus](http://www.nexussafe.com/).

## Core ##
Download the core jar [here](http://code.google.com/p/scimproxy/source/browse/trunk/ScimCore/target/scimcore.jar). See WorkingWithScimCore for example code.

Example:
```
String jsonScimUser = "{\"schemas\": [\"urn:scim:schemas:core:user:1.0\"], \"id\": \"005D0000001Az1u\",  \"userName\": \"bjensen@example.com\" }";
ScimUser user = new ScimUser(jsonScimUser,  ScimUser.ENCODING_JSON);
```

## Proxy ##

A scimproxy binary will soon be uploaded for testing. Right now, just download the project and run maven jetty:run to startup the scimproxy. See [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.md) and [Configuration](Configuration.md) for more information.

## Viewer ##

The proxy includes a SCIM user viewer that lists, deletes, edits and batch import users. Access it on running server. If a downstream or upstream server is configured you can use the viewer to browse and edit there users to.
`<server>:<port>/Viewer/List`

## Compliance tests ##

scimproxy is used to build the official SCIM compliance tests found on http://www.simplecloud.info. You can find the code here http://code.google.com/p/scimproxy/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fscimcompliance. It's still in beta and we plan to add and improve tests. Feedback and comments are more then welcome.
